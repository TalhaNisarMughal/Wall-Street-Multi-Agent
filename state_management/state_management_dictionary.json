Uncertainty Handling and Trainer Control:\\no The model will alert the trainer when uncertain about a response, allowing\\ntrainer intervention to guide the conversation.\\no Trainers can pause the model at any point to take manual control.\\no The system will learn from trainer input through a real-time feedback loop\\nto enhance future interactions.\\n3. System Prompt Training and Feedback Storage:\\no The GPT model will follow a predefined system prompt for conversational\\nstyle, tone, and guidelines.\\no Trainer feedback during live sessions will be appended to the system\\nprompt and stored in MongoDB to continually improve conversation flow.\\n4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pinecone:\\no Pinecone will be used for knowledge storage and retrieval, enabling the\\nGPT model to respond with contextually relevant information from a\\nvectorized knowledge base.\\no The text-embedding-ada-002 model from OpenAI will generate\\nembeddings for efficient knowledge retrieval.\\n5.
